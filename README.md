# CoviChecker
## Introduction
View our deployed application here:https://covi-checker.herokuapp.com/
## Idea
We are striving to create a monitoring system in the form of a web application
that would help  the users to keep track of their important health parameters like Sp02 Level, Body Temperature, Pulse Rate and Blood Pressure as well as their  medicines and to monitor the same on a daily and timely basis. This would help the patients monitor their activities and remain assured that they don’t miss on any of these parameters. And also the logs of these would help them easily to consult the doctor as the information is already there in a proper order.
We are also planning to give this info to their loved one’s, so that they can also keep track of their medications.
