# Introduction
In this pandemic, majority of the covid positive patients are  isolated in their homes. Lack of hospital beds and isolation centers has made it impossible for most patients to get access to professional medicare one gets in hospitals like nurses, ward boys etc. Most of the time these patients have to take care of their parameters and their medicines on an daily and timely  basis as this is crucial for their recovery. Being isolated and sick at the same time it becomes quite difficult for the patient to keep track of their parameters and take meds without a fail. Tracking parameters and not missing any medicines is extremely important as failing to do so may lead to devastating health deteoritation and even death. 80% of covid positive patients in india recover in their homes. So we have come up with a practical solution to this problem. We have created a notification system along with a parameter log tracker which would help these patients keep track of their parameters and medicines on a timely interval. They could later refer to these logs while consulting their doctor regarding their health status.
## What does our application do?
* Sends hourly notifications to users, so that they dont forget to track their parameters.
* Keeps track of the medicines taken and missed.
* Users can view previous entries in the form of an ordered log, which they can use to consult with their doctors with ease.
* Resources fetcher which displays the verified resources from Twitter based upon the city of the user.
* Community page for the users to interact
* Chat-bot to improve the mood of isolated patients.
